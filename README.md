# DivvyDriveCloneApp

During my internship, I worked extensively on developing a cloud-based file management application for iOS using Swift and UIKit. The project involved implementing key functionalities such as file and folder operations (upload, delete, move), user authentication, and data security. I designed a dynamic network layer that handled all RESTful API interactions with the backend, supporting various file management operations. This network layer enabled seamless communication between the app and the server, ensuring efficient data retrieval and updates.

One of the significant challenges I tackled was implementing file integrity checks using hash functions like MD5, SHA256, and SHA512. I developed a mechanism to split large files into chunks, hash each chunk, and verify data integrity during uploads. For files larger than 5MB, I used a multi-part upload system, which involved creating metadata, uploading chunks sequentially, and then publishing the complete file once all parts were successfully uploaded. This approach ensured the reliability and security of data transferred between the client and the server.

The user interface of the application was built with `UICollectionView`, providing dynamic views for displaying files and folders. I implemented both grid and list views, allowing users to switch between different display modes based on their preference. The views were updated in real-time using a diffable data source, which handled changes like file uploads and deletions efficiently.

For page management, I used `SceneDelegate` to control transitions between the splash screen, login view, and main app interface. I integrated user authentication mechanisms, enabling secure login and logout processes. The app's session management was handled smoothly, with transitions between views triggered by user actions.

Communication between different view controllers was managed using custom protocols, ensuring a decoupled and maintainable codebase. Protocols facilitated the delegation of actions, such as updating file lists after operations or navigating between different screens. While Notification Center was used in some parts for broad message broadcasting, protocols provided a more structured and specific way to handle communication.

Throughout the project, I adhered to the MVC and MVVM design patterns, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and maintainability of the codebase. The use of SOLID principles allowed for a scalable and extensible architecture, making it easier to add new features or modify existing ones.

I also collaborated closely with senior developers, gaining valuable insights into advanced iOS development practices and cloud system integration. This experience enhanced my skills in problem-solving, debugging, and optimizing the app's performance. Overall, the internship provided a comprehensive understanding of iOS development, from network communication and data security to UI design and architecture patterns, preparing me for future challenges in software development.
